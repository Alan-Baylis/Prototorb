# Prototorb
Hobby project made using Unity 5.4. About procedural generation and Rogue Lite/Shoot them up Elements.

The game is still at an early steps but the procedural algorithm works.
Controls are rather simple at this point aswel, but required a 360 controller.
  - Left stick : roll around
  - Right trigger : shoot.

Game is still on developpement, I plan to add AI, more weapons and pick ups in rooms.
